## üîç Security Scanning & GitHub Advanced Security

This repository implements comprehensive security scanning using multiple tools and services:

### Automated Security Scans

- **üîé CodeQL Static Analysis**:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript security vulnerability detection
  - Security-extended query suite
  - Custom configuration excluding test files

- **‚òÅÔ∏è SonarCloud Code Quality & Security**:
  - Continuous code quality analysis
  - Security hotspot detection
  - Code coverage tracking
  - Quality gate enforcement

- **üì¶ Dependency Security Audit**:
  - pnpm audit for npm package vulnerabilities  
  - Automated vulnerability severity assessment
  - License compliance verification

- **üê≥ Docker Security Scanning**:
  - Base image vulnerability assessment
  - Multi-image scanning matrix
  - Security best practices validation

### Scan Frequency & Triggers

- **Pull Requests**: All security scans run automatically
- **Push to main/develop**: Full security verification
- **Daily Schedule**: Complete audit at 2 AM UTC
- **Manual Triggers**: On-demand security assessments

### Security Severity Levels

| Severity | Action Required | Timeline |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Immediate fix, deployment blocked | 24 hours |
| **HIGH** | Priority fix required | 7 days |
| **MEDIUM** | Fix in next release cycle | 30 days |
| **LOW** | Fix when convenient | Next major release |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
