# GitHub Advanced Security Configuration

## Current Status
‚ùå **GitHub Advanced Security is NOT enabled** for this private repository  
‚ùå **Dependency Graph is NOT enabled**  
‚ùå **Dependency Review Action requires these features**

## Impact
- `actions/dependency-review-action@v4` fails with error:
  ```
  Dependency review is not supported on this repository. 
  Please ensure that Dependency graph is enabled along with 
  GitHub Advanced Security on private repositories
  ```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Enable GitHub Advanced Security (Recommended)
1. **Go to Repository Settings** ‚Üí **Code security and analysis**
2. **Enable Dependency Graph**
3. **Enable GitHub Advanced Security** (requires paid plan for private repos)
4. **Enable Dependabot alerts**
5. **Enable Code scanning**

**Cost**: Requires GitHub Advanced Security license (~$21/month per active committer)

### Option 2: Alternative Security Scanning (Current Implementation)
We've implemented alternative dependency security scanning in `.github/workflows/security.yml`:

#### Features:
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Vulnerability Audit**: `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate`
- ‚úÖ **License Compliance Check**: Scans for GPL/AGPL licenses
- ‚úÖ **Package Change Analysis**: Detects package.json modifications
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Scanning**: File system vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ **CodeQL Static Analysis**: JavaScript/TypeScript code scanning

#### Security Coverage:
```yaml
dependency-security:
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning (pnpm audit)
  - License compliance checking
  - Package change detection
  - Manual review prompts for security implications

security-scan:
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - SARIF output for GitHub Security tab
  - Container and dependency vulnerability detection

codeql-analysis:
  - Static code analysis
  - Security-focused queries
  - JavaScript/TypeScript support
```

## Current Vulnerability Status
As of August 4, 2025:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **1 moderate severity** vulnerability found in `esbuild@0.19.12`
- üìù **Recommendation**: Update to `esbuild@0.25.0+`
- üîç **Path**: Indirect dependency through NX tools

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úÖ **Use alternative security scanning** (already implemented)
2. üîß **Update esbuild dependency** to resolve vulnerability
3. üìã **Monitor security alerts** through workflow results

### Long-term Strategy:
1. **Consider GitHub Advanced Security** for comprehensive coverage
2. **Regular dependency updates** using Dependabot or manual reviews
3. **Security-focused CI/CD** with our custom scanning approach

## Workflow Configuration
Our security workflow provides equivalent functionality without requiring GitHub Advanced Security:

- **Scheduled scans**: Daily at 2 AM UTC
- **PR checks**: Runs on every pull request
- **Multiple scanning methods**: Covers different vulnerability types
- **License compliance**: Prevents problematic license introduction
- **SARIF integration**: Results appear in GitHub Security tab

## Migration Path
If you later enable GitHub Advanced Security:
1. Remove the `dependency-security` job from `security.yml`
2. Add back the standard `dependency-review-action`
3. Enable additional GitHub security features
4. Configure Dependabot for automated updates

---
**Status**: Alternative security scanning implemented and functional  
**Next Review**: Monitor for new vulnerabilities and consider GitHub Advanced Security
