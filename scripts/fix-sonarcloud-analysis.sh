echo ""
echo "✅ Great news! Your SONAR_TOKEN is working correctly!"
echo ""
echo "🚨 Issue: Automatic Analysis is enabled in SonarCloud"
echo "   This conflicts with GitHub Actions CI analysis."
echo ""
echo "📋 To fix this:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🌐 Go to your SonarCloud project:"
echo "   https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=davequintana_equipment-share-demo"
echo ""
echo "2. ⚙️  Navigate to Administration → Analysis Method:"
echo "   - Click on your project name"
echo "   - Go to 'Administration' tab (top menu)"
echo "   - Select 'Analysis Method' from the left sidebar"
echo ""
echo "3. 🔄 Change Analysis Method:"
echo "   - Switch from 'Automatic Analysis' to 'CI-based analysis'"
echo "   - Select 'GitHub Actions'"
echo "   - Save the changes"
echo ""
echo "4. ✅ Re-run your GitHub Actions workflow:"
echo "   - Go to: https://github.com/davequintana/equipment-share-demo/actions"
echo "   - Find the failed workflow run"
echo "   - Click 'Re-run jobs' or push a new commit"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Why this happens:"
echo "   SonarCloud can analyze your code in two ways:"
echo "   - Automatic: SonarCloud pulls and analyzes automatically"
echo "   - CI-based: GitHub Actions runs the analysis with coverage data"
echo ""
echo "   CI-based analysis is better because it includes test coverage!"
echo ""
echo "⏱️  This should take less than 2 minutes to fix."
